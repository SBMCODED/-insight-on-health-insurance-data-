This project aimed to analyze a health insurance dataset using various data analysis techniques, including clustering and fitting prediction. The dataset comprised several features such as age, sex, BMI, smoker status, and medical history. Through clustering analysis, we segmented the data into distinct groups based on similarity, allowing for better understanding of underlying patterns and groupings within the dataset. Fitting prediction involved estimating the performance of predictive models, particularly linear regression, in capturing patterns within the data. Both clustering and fitting analysis provided valuable insights into the dataset, facilitating informed decision-making in the realm of health insurance. Additionally, various graphical representations, including scatter plots, histograms, and regression lines, were employed to visualize the data and model predictions. Overall, this project showcased the application of data analysis techniques in the domain of health insurance, aiming to improve understanding, prediction accuracy, and decision-making processes.
